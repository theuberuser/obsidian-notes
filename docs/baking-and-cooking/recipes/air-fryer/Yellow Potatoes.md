### 2. Prepare the potatoes

1. Wash and scrub the potatoes well

### 3. Oil and season

1. Pour **½–1 teaspoon oil per potato** into your hand
    
2. Rub the oil evenly over the skin

You want a **thin, shiny coat**, not greasy.

### 4. Cook

1. Place potatoes in the air fryer basket
    
    - Don’t overcrowd
        
    - Leave space between them
        
2. Cook at **400°F (200°C)** for:
    
    - **18–25 minutes total**

### 5. Check for doneness

They’re done when:

- A fork slides in easily
    
- The skin looks lightly blistered
    
- They feel soft when gently squeezed (use a towel)
    

If not done:

- Add **3–5 more minutes**

### 6. Rest

- Remove potatoes
    
- Let them sit **3–5 minutes** before eating
    

This improves texture and is a bit gentler on digestion.

## Helpful Notes

- Yellow potatoes won’t get as crunchy as russets — that’s normal
    
- Smaller potatoes cook faster; check early
    
- These reheat well in the air fryer (350°F for 5–7 min)
