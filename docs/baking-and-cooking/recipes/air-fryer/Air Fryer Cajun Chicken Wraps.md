#### **Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Chicken:**
    
    - Pat the chicken strips dry and place them in a bowl.
        
    - Drizzle olive oil over the chicken and toss to coat.
        
    - In a small bowl, mix the Cajun seasoning, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.
        
    - Rub the seasoning mixture all over the chicken strips.
        
2. **Cook the Chicken in the Air Fryer:**
    
    - Preheat the air fryer to 375°F (190°C) for 3–5 minutes.
        
    - Place the chicken strips in a single layer in the air fryer basket (work in batches if needed).
        
    - Cook for 10–12 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the chicken is golden brown and the internal temperature reaches **165°F (74°C)**.
        
3. **Assemble the Wraps:**
    
    - Warm the tortillas slightly in a skillet or microwave for easier rolling.
        
    - Spread a thin layer of sour cream or Greek yogurt on each tortilla.
        
    - Add shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, shredded cheese, and red onion (if using).
        
    - Place a few chicken strips on top of the fillings.
        
    - Drizzle with hot sauce, ranch dressing, or mayonnaise, if desired.
        
4. **Roll the Wraps:**
    
    - Fold the sides of the tortilla over the filling, then roll tightly from the bottom up.
        
    - Secure with a toothpick if needed.
        
5. **Serve:**
    
    - Serve the wraps warm with a side of chips, fries, or a simple salad. You can also slice them in half for easier handling.
